# BobbyCodes (Sometimes Live!)

👋 Howdy Folks! I’m @bobbycodeslive!

This is my Github account associated with everything BobbyCodes related!

Maybe it will have some cool things? 

Or maybe it will just be another graveyard of half finished code projects.

Either way it should be a blast!

Things you should know:

- 🐧 I'm a huge nerd for Linux! _(I use Arch BTW)_
- 👨‍🎓 I’m currently learning Go and studying CKAD.
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you don't use Neovim we might not be able to be friends...
